# DSA-Petful

This is a web app for an animal shelter that allows adoption of cats and dogs. These are the only two animals allowed in the shelter at a time. The adoption process works strictly on a first-in, first-out basis. People can adopt a cat, or a dog, or both, but they may only adopt the oldest one (by arrival time, not age) that is in the shelter.
